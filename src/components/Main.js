            <p>In hopes of saving the rare Swampian race, the Genesis frogs were tasked with finding a new place to settle and call home. After what felt like an eternity of roaming and browsing the universe the Genesis frogs discovered an abandoned swamp, with enough potential to support the future of the Swampanian race. This breathtaking marshland would forever be known as the Swampverse. A swamp, unlike any other in the universe, with copious greenery, saturated soils, and a vast environment to evolve. With a home secure, the Genesis strategically combined their DNA with the remaining !vibe to produce, the first and last generation, of 9600 distinctive Swampverse frogs. Each individual frog will live its life, but they will prosper together as an ecosystem. </p><br /><br />
              <p>However, the journey has just started.</p><br /><br />
                <p>The Genesis are out of !vibe, and they are ascending into Swamphalla to rest after fulfilling their noble duty. The 9600 frogs are left to decipher The Lore, and work together to conquer their biggest challenge ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.</p>
               
<br /><br />
              <span>Genesis Frogs</span><br /><br /> 
<p>The genesis are the first of there kind. Only 96 exist in the universe. All genesis are 1 of 1's, fully animated, inlcuding the background as well. Their utility is still being researched at the lab in Utopia. All we know is:</p><br />
<li>Only 32 will be airdropped to holders who hold a certain amount of $TOKEN.</li>
<li>The 64 remaning will be stealth dropped.</li>
<li>Gain access to Swamphalla.</li>
<li>Release sometime in Swampmap v1.</li>
<br /><br /><br />
  <span>Frogs</span><br /><br /> 
<p>In order to expand & save the swampian race the Genesis fused their DNA toghter and created 9600 unique frogs. Not only these have sweet utility but they act as a profile pic being able to perfectly size for anything from Discord to Twitter. Frogs love to croak which generates a $TOKEN. Some of their other exciting utilities are: </p><br />
<li>Burn any 2 frogs together for a mysterious creature with X $TOKEN.</li>
<li>Unlock exclusive channels in the Discord server.</li>
<li>Have a vote in the community.</li>
<li>Unlock a 3D / VX version with X $TOKEN.</li>
<li>Yield X $TOKEN a day.</li>
<br /><br /><br />
    <span>Mysterious Creature</span><br /><br /> 
<p>These mysterious swamp creatures are still being researched at the janky lab in Swampville on what they exactly do. The Lore shows a name for them but it seems to be unreadable. Only the technology founds in Utopia can be used to decipher the Lore currently...</p><br />
